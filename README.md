🌀 Creative Landing Page with GSAP Animations
An immersive and modern React-based landing page enhanced with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to deliver smooth cursor trails, scroll-driven animations, and interactive elements. This project showcases fluid UI transitions, advanced animation control, and pixel-perfect responsiveness—perfect for user-focused brands and product showcases.

🚀 Key Features
🎯 Custom Animated Cursor
Three layered, responsive cursor trails using GSAP for realistic motion effects.

📜 Scroll-Triggered Animations
Beautifully animated components (like bottles, caps, and text) that animate dynamically based on scroll position using ScrollTrigger.

🌈 Modern UI & Responsive Design
Clean layout with toggleable sidebar for better content focus and control.

💡 Smooth UX Enhancements
Motion blur, easing, and staggered transitions enhance interactivity without hurting performance.

⚛️ Built with React + GSAP
Modern frontend stack using React (with hooks), GSAP, and ScrollTrigger plugin for precise control over animations.

✨ How It Works
On mousemove, three cursor elements (.cursor, .cursor2, .cursor3) follow the pointer with different easing and delays to create a trailing effect.

Scroll-triggered elements (like .bottle and .bottle-cap) animate into position when .section2 enters the viewport.

Sidebar toggling is handled via state and Tailwind or CSS transitions for seamless interaction.
